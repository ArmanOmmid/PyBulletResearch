# PyBulletResearch

# Goal:

The robotics project would start like this: in Pybullet, build a
simulated ground vehicle that is supposed to go
from an initial location to some goal location, and there are random
static obstacles in between. Then have this environment connected with
OpenAI Gym so that you can run standard policy gradient RL algorithms
such as PPO and SAC to train the controller for the car so that it
goes from the initial state to the goal and avoid the obstacles.

Getting familiar with these tools may require quite some effort, so
take your time and let me know when you have something working.
